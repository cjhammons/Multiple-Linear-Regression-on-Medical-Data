# Multiple Linear Regression on Medical Data

The goal of this project was to perform multiple linear regressino on medical data, a continuation of [this project](https://github.com/cjhammons/Cleaning-Medical-Data).

Code can be found [here](https://github.com/cjhammons/Multiple-Linear-Regression-on-Medical-Data/blob/master/multiple-linear-regression.ipynb), and a report can be found [here](https://github.com/cjhammons/Multiple-Linear-Regression-on-Medical-Data/blob/master/final-report.md)
